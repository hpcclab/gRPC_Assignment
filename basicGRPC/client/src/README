*** The following briefly explains the client-node.js code ***

Lines 1-21 are some declarations and options that are used later in the file.

Lines 24-26 & 37-39 are simple error handling. It really isn't robust but it gets the job done.

The switch statement at line 33 allows the program to recognize which function the user called.
This makes it easier to retrofit a new function for redesigns.

Lines 45-50 are the central machination of this program. The client object knows where to make procedure call to, or
in other words, where the server is located. It passes to it which function is wishes to call, as well as its arguments.
The server then returns some result after processing this request.
